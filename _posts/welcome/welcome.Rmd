Hi! Although I hope readers find something useful or interesting from this blog, for now it's mostly a place for me to bring together - and possible refine more - techniques I have used. I've found that I like having examples of my own work I can copy-paste-adapt. 

I'm guessing I'll run my code on examples provided in base R most of the time but I don't promise consistency in that regard.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
